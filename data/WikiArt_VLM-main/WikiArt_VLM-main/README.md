This repository contains a collection of AI-generated images created from paintings in the [WikiArt dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/huggan/wikiart).

## Repository Structure

- `All_gpt4.1-mini_prompt.xlsx`: Prompts generated by GPT-4.1-mini for each original artwork, used as input for text-to-image models.
- `images/`:Original artworks from the WikiArt dataset (excluding works by "Unknown Artist"), along with their corresponding AI-generated paintings based on GPT-4.1-mini descriptions.

## Dataset Preprocessing

The WikiArt dataset is sorted by artist name using the following code:

```python
from datasets import load_dataset

ds = load_dataset("huggan/wikiart")
ds["train"] = ds["train"].sort("artist", reverse=True)
